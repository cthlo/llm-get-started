"content": "# Getting started with identity theft monitoring in Microsoft Defender\n\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Experian\u00ae\u202fto bring world class identity theft monitoring\u202fto Microsoft Defender. Defender\u2019s Identity Theft Monitoring consists of four major components: Dark web monitoring, credit monitoring\u00b9, 24/7 restoration support, and identity theft insurance.\u202f2\n\nCombined, these functionalities allow you to monitor your own identity details (as well as your family\u2019s) for breaches\u202fon both the public internet and the dark web, keep track of (attempted) identity theft and fraud, get expert support when you need it the most, and enjoy the peace of mind that you\u2019re covered for up to $1M USD in identity theft related costs, as well as up to $100k USD in lost funds.\u202f\u00a0\n\n## How does dark web monitoring\u00a0work?\n\nWhen we spot your personal details in a breach, you\u2019ll receive an alert and a detailed breach report telling you exactly what data was found and where. You'll get\u202frecommendations on what to do right away to address the situation, details on how this might have happened, information on the possible risks, and\u202ftips on how to reduce the chances of it happening again.\u00a0\n\n## What can we monitor?\n\nDark web monitoring can monitor these personal details:\n\n*   Email addresses\n    \n*   Passwords\n    \n*   Full name\n    \n*   Date of birth\n    \n*   Phone number(s)\n    \n*   Social Security number\n    \n*   National IDs\n    \n*   Driver\u2019s license number\n    \n*   Medical IDs\n    \n*   Mother\u2019s maiden name\n    \n*   Passport numbers\n    \n*   Bank account details\n    \n*   International bank account numbers\n    \n*   Credit card details\n    \n*   Retail card numbers\n    \n*   eBay credentials\n    \n*   PayPal credentials\n    \n\nYou choose which of these information types you want us to monitor.\n\nTo start monitoring you'll need to tell us at least your email address, full name, and date of birth.\n\nThe service will notify you if it discovers a breach that contains any of the pieces of information you have asked it to monitor. Additionally, it may discover other related personal information, such as your home address or the CVV code of your credit card\u00a0and will report that to you as well.\n\n## How does credit monitoring work?\u00a0\n\nCredit monitoring constantly tracks the state of your credit file as well as any attempts to associate your Social Security Number (SSN) with a new address or identity. Whenever any potentially malicious activity occurs, you will receive an alert with the exact details on what happened, when it happened, and who the party involved in the activity is (including contact details where available).\u00a0\n\nIf you recognize this activity, you simply open the alert and confirm it was you by selecting Yes, I recognize this. The event is then stored in your credit alerts history, should you want to look it up at a later date.\u00a0\n\nIf you do not recognize the activity, select No, I don\u2019t recognize this\u00a0to receive a list of recommended next steps (such as placing a credit freeze, contacting the involved party\u2019s fraud department) that can help you address the situation.\u00a0\n\n## How does the restoration service work?\u00a0\n\nIn case you\u2019d like more help after following the recommended next steps (for either dark web monitoring or credit monitoring alerts) you can contact Experian\u2019s 24/7 identity theft monitoring support for Microsoft Defender customers at 833-533-1838 to speak to a restoration expert who can guide you through the process of addressing the breached details or credit issue and even provide full-service identity restoration services in the event an identity thief is using your personal details to commit fraud.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1.  Go to the Microsoft Defender\u00a0app on your device or the My Defender portal ([https://mydefender.microsoft.com](--link-redacted--)) on the web.\n    \n2.  Locate the Identity theft monitoring card (if you have not set up identity theft monitoring previously) or Credit\u202fmonitoring card (in case you previously set up Identity theft monitoring) on your Defender dashboard and select Get started.\n    \n3.  Follow the steps to create your profile and make sure to read and accept the terms of service.\n    \n4.  If you want to set up credit monitoring as well as dark web monitoring, provide your Social Security Number when prompted.\n    \n\n## Adding family members in dark web monitoring\n\nTo add a family member, select the Identity Details card, then select\u00a0their avatar from the top row of the card.\u00a0\n\nFamily members over the statutory age (13 in the U.S.) need to consent to being monitored before you can add them.\n\nIf the family member you want to monitor has not yet consented to identity monitoring, you'll be prompted to request their consent.\n\n## How will I get notified?\u00a0\n\nWhenever a piece of data you've asked us to monitor\u202f- either for yourself or a family member - is found to have been leaked online, you'll get an alert on every device that you're signed into Microsoft Defender\u00a0on. The alert will also appear on the into the\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0dashboard, and in the Alerts & History page in Defender.\u00a0\n\nFrom the alerts you're just a click away from more information and a detailed checklist of things you can do.\u00a0\n\n## How will I get notified of any credit activity?\u00a0\n\nWhenever we detect new activity on your credit file, you\u2019ll receive an alert on all devices signed into \u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0, via email, and show up on your \u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0 dashboard, as well as in your Alerts & History (similar to dark web monitoring).\u00a0\n\nAs with dark web monitoring alerts, if you interact with the alert in any of these scenarios, you\u2019ll open the alert in the \u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0\u00a0app (or on the Defender web portal if no client is present on your device) to present you with the details of the event.\u00a0\n\n## How do we protect your data?\n\nWhen you add a piece of information to be monitored, we securely transmit that info to Experian\u00ae. Microsoft doesn't see or keep your personal information.\n\n## How to report problems or make suggestions\n\nWe rely on your feedback to help improve this feature, and we encourage you to report any issues you encounter.\n\nPlease submit your feedback through the app or portal by selecting your user icon, then selecting\u00a0Help and feedback.\n\nGive us a clear description of the problem or suggestion, along with specific steps you took when you found the problem.\u00a0\n\n## Got questions? Get answers!\n\nCome to [the Microsoft Answers community for Microsoft Defender](--link-redacted--) to talk about the app with other people who are using it.\u00a0\n\n## Learn more\n\n[Protecting yourself from identity theft online](--link-redacted--)\n\nThis article was created by a person with the assistance of an artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n1.
