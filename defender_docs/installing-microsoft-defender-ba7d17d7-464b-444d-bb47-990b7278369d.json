Windows devices from threats\u00a0by installing Microsoft Defender.\u00a0Download Microsoft Defender on your devices either by:\n\n*   Scanning the following QR code\n    \n    \u00a0\n    \n*   Searching for Microsoft Defender in your app store\n    \n*   Sharing with your devices,\u00a0the following link:\u00a0 Glyph Library: fluent Glyph Name: Link\u00a0[Copy link](--link-redacted--)\n    \n\nWe\u00a0encourage you to install Microsoft Defender on at least five\u00a0devices per person.\n\nThis article is about the\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0app that is included with\u00a0[Microsoft 365 Family](--link-redacted--) or [Personal](--link-redacted--) subscriptions. If you're looking for information about the Microsoft Defender Antivirus that is built into Windows, see\u00a0[Stay protected with Windows Security.](--link-redacted--)\n\n## Ready to give it a try?\n\nAndroid\n\n1.  Open [https://aka.ms/AndroidDefender](--link-redacted--)\u00a0(or scan the QR code below) on your Android\u00a0device to go to Microsoft Defender\u00a0in the Google Play Store.\n    \n    If your device has both a Personal Profile\u00a0and a Work Profile, then you need to\u00a0install the app in the Personal Profile.\n    \n2.  Follow the installation steps on the Play Store page.\n    \n3.  After installing, sign in with the personal Microsoft account (such as @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com) that is associated with your Microsoft 365 subscription.\n    \n\nWhen you first sign into\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0on Android, we'll walk you through a few easy steps that start\u00a0with setting up [web protection](--link-redacted--). During this process, we'll ask you to give Defender permission to do two things: run in the background and use the Accessibility Service.\n\n### Run in the background\u00a0\n\nA security tool that only works sometimes\u00a0isn't nearly as effective. You want\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0to always watch\u00a0your back, protecting you from the malicious sites you weren't expecting. In order to do that, Defender needs permission to run in the background.\n\n### Accessibility service\n\nIn order to make sure the site you're going to isn't known to be dangerous, Defender needs to be able to see the address. To do that on\u00a0Android, we use the Accessibility Service\u00a0to read, almost literally, the address from your browser.\n\nOnly one app at a time can have permission to use the Accessibility Service. If you give that permission to a different app, web protection in Defender will be turned off.\n\nAfter setting up web protection, we'll set up [anti-malware protection](--link-redacted--). To do this we need to ask for a couple more permissions.\n\n### Access device storage\n\nMicrosoft Defender\u00a0scans apps and files on your device to watch for possible threats. To do that, it needs to be able to access those files. We only use that permission to look for malicious apps, a\u00a0process that happens entirely on your device. No information about your apps or files is sent to Microsoft.\n\n### Send notifications\n\nIf you want\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0to tell you if we find a threat, you'll need to allow us to send you notifications on your device.\n\n### Run in the background\n\nIf you already allowed\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0to run in the background for web protection, you won't be asked for this permission again.\n\nProtecting your device is a full-time job, but you probably want to use your device for other things, like texting, gaming, work, and\u00a0entertainment. By allowing\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0to run in the background, you allow us to help keep you safer all the time.\n\n### Let's finish with a scan\u00a0\n\nFinally, Microsoft Defender\u00a0will run an initial scan of your device to see if there are threats already on it. This scan usually only takes a minute or two.\u00a0\n\nIf that initial scan finds any threats\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0will notify you and help you remove them.\n\niOS\n\n1.  Open [https://aka.ms/iosDefender](--link-redacted--)\u00a0(or scan the QR code below)\u00a0on your iOS device to go to Microsoft Defender in the Apple App Store and follow the installation steps.  \n    \n2.  After installing, sign in with the personal Microsoft account (such as @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com) that is associated with your Microsoft 365 subscription.\n    \n\nWhen you first sign into\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0on iOS, we'll walk you through a few easy steps that to\u00a0set\u00a0up [web protection](--link-redacted--). During this process, we'll ask you to give Defender permission to do two things: set up a local virtual private network (VPN) and allow notifications.\n\n### A local VPN?\n\nDue\u00a0to the built-in security settings in iOS, other apps aren't able to see the address (URL)\u00a0an app is trying to open, including those\u00a0being opened in the web browser. To make sure the site you're going to isn't known to be dangerous, Defender needs to be able to see the address.\n\nTo do that, we set up a local VPN. It's called a local VPN because it never leaves your device\u2014it's just a connection between your browser and Microsoft Defender running on your device.\n\nWhen you click on a link, the browser sends the address you're going to through that local VPN to Defender.\u00a0Defender checks the address\u00a0and then\u00a0(assuming it's good), lets the browser open that site. The whole thing\u00a0happens so quickly you won't even notice.\n\n### Allow notifications\n\nIf the site is found to be malicious\u00a0that's where notifications come in. We block access to the site, but iOS won't let us notify you of the problem in the browser, so instead we send you a\u00a0notification telling you that the site you're trying to go to is dangerous. From that notification you can close the browser tab\u00a0and stay safe. Or, if you're completely sure that the site is safe,\u00a0you can choose to continue to the site anyway.\n\nYou can choose not to allow notifications and web protection will still work, but you won't get the notification that it was Defender who blocked the site you were trying to go to.\n\nWindows\n\nWhen you install the Microsoft 365 apps on your Windows device, the Microsoft Defender app will automatically be installed for you along with the other apps. If you installed the Microsoft 365 apps before Defender was released, and you still have an active Microsoft 365 Family or Personal subscription, then the Defender app was automatically added to your Windows device as part of an update.\n\nEven if it's installed, Microsoft Defender isn't activated until you sign into the app.\n\nJust launch it from the Start menu (or click the button below) and sign in with the personal Microsoft account you use for Microsoft 365.\n\n[Open Defender](--link-redacted--)\n\n### If you don't have an active Microsoft 365 subscription right now\n\n1.  Open\u00a0[https://aka.ms/WindowsDefender](--link-redacted--)\u00a0to go to Microsoft Defender in the Microsoft Store and select Install.\n    \n2.  After installing, sign in with the personal Microsoft account (such as @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com).\n    \n\n### To uninstall Defender\n\nFind **Microsoft Defender** on your Start menu, right-click it and select Uninstall.\n\nIf you uninstall the app it will not be automatically reinstalled. You can reinstall it manually by going to\u00a0[https://aka.ms/WindowsDefender](--link-redacted--) and selecting **Install**.\n\nMac\n\nMicrosoft Defender on Mac requires macOS 10.14 or later.\n\n1.  Open [https://aka.ms/MacDefender](--link-redacted--)\u00a0on your device to download the WDAV.PKG installation file.\n    \n2.  Open the WDAV package file on your Mac and follow the installation steps.\n    \n3.  After installing, sign in with the personal Microsoft account (such as @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com) that is associated with your Microsoft 365 subscription.\n    \n\nWhen you first sign into\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0on Mac, we'll will walk you through a few easy steps to set\u00a0up [anti-malware protection](--link-redacted--) on\u00a0your device.\n\nDuring this process, we need you to give\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0a couple of permissions so that it can protect you.\n\n### System access\n\nTo start with, we'll have you open the Security settings, then follow these steps:\n\n1\\. Select the padlock at the bottom left so you can make changes. You'll be prompted to enter your password or other authentication.\n\n2\\. You should see a prompt that says that Some system software requires your attention before it can be used.\u00a0\u00a0Select the Details\u00a0button.\n\n3\\. If you see a dialog asking you to select Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Defender Extension, select both and then OK.\n\nIf you're using macOS Catalina (10.15) you may\u00a0simply see an Allow button, rather than Details.\u00a0\n\nOnce that's done, select the padlock again to prevent further changes.\n\n### Access files\n\nNext, we'll need permission to access your files.\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0scans apps and files looking for threats and it can only do that if it has permission to access the files. We'll ask you to select Open Privacy Settings, then follow these steps:\n\n1\\. Select Full Disk Access.\n\n2\\. Select Microsoft Defender and (if you see it)\u00a0Microsoft Defender Extension.\n\n### Let's finish with a scan\u00a0\n\nFinally, Microsoft Defender\u00a0will run an initial scan of your device to see if there are any threats already on it. That scan may take a while\u2014depending on the speed of your device and how many apps you have\u2014but you can keep using your computer while the scan runs in the background.\n\nIf that initial scan finds any threats\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0will notify you and help you remove them.\n\nIf\u00a0Microsoft Defender\u00a0is successfully installed and running, you'll see its icon on the title bar near the clock at the top right.\u00a0  \n\n## Share your security status with family organizers\n\nIf you're part of a Microsoft 365 Family subscription the last step is to decide if you'd like to share your security status with your family organizers.
